### Project Overview 
##### Identifying Financial Literacy Gaps for InvestInMinds Foundation

This project aims to analyze survey data to pinpoint key demographics with the greatest need for **financial literacy programs**, directly informing **InvestInMinds** Foundation's initiatives and maximizing their impact on underserved communities. As a Research and Data Analyst Intern, the core responsibilities will revolve around data analysis, visualization, and strategic recommendations.

##### Key Project Objectives:

Identify demographic groups most in need of financial literacy programs.
Guide InvestInMinds Foundation's program targeting and resource allocation.
Project Tasks:

- Data Cleaning: This involves identifying and addressing inconsistencies and missing data within the provided dataset. A documented process of handling these issues is required.
- Data Analysis: This includes calculating average financial literacy scores for various demographic segments (age, income, education, and location) and identifying patterns, particularly focusing on groups with significantly lower scores.
- Data Visualization: Creating at least two visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, tables) to effectively communicate key findings. Examples include comparing financial literacy scores by age group or segmenting scores by income level and location.
- Recommendations: Developing a concise report (1-2 pages) summarizing the findings, highlighting 2-3 demographic groups with the lowest financial literacy levels, and providing actionable suggestions for InvestInMinds Foundation to address these gaps.
##### Provided Dataset:

The dataset includes the following variables:

1. Age Group: Under 18, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+
2. Household Income: Low (<$30,000), Middle ($30,000-$70,000), High (>$70,000)
3. Education Level: High School or Less, Some College, Bachelor’s Degree, Graduate Degree
4. Financial Literacy Score: Numerical scores (0-100) representing survey responses.
5. Location: Urban, Suburban, Rural


##### Deliverables:

1. A cleaned dataset with documented changes.
2. A 1-2 page report summarizing findings and recommendations.
3. Two visualizations (embedded in the report or as separate files).

*Due Date: Next Monday 20 jan 2025 .*
